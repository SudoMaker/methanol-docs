# Links and Navigation

Methanol utilizes a file-based routing mechanism. Internal links can be created simply by referencing the route path of the target file.

## Internal Links

Reference site routes without file extensions:

```md
[Writing Basics](./writing)
```

Rendered result: [Writing Basics](./writing)

If a page is moved or renamed, ensure that any links pointing to it are updated accordingly.

### Subpath Deployments (`site.base`)

If your site is hosted under a subpath (e.g., `https://example.com/docs/`), ensure `site.base: '/docs/'` is configured. In such cases, avoid using root-absolute links like `/blog/post` within your content.

Relative linking is recommended:

```md
[Next post](./next-post)
[Back to blog](../blog/)
```

If you need to generate a root-absolute link within MDX or JSX, wrap the path with `ctx.withBase`:

```mdx
<a href={ctx.withBase('/blog/post')}>Read</a>
```

## External Links

For external destinations, use fully qualified URLs:

```md
[Example](https://example.com)
```

Rendered result: [Example](https://example.com)

## Navigation Hierarchy

Use Frontmatter properties to control the configured order and visibility of pages:

- `weight`: Lower numerical values are positioned higher in the navigation.
- `hidden`: Excludes the page from the sidebar menu.
- `isRoot`: Defines an `index.mdx` file as the root of a navigation sub-tree.

For complete specifications, refer to the [Frontmatter Reference](../reference/frontmatter).
