# Links and Navigation

Methanol uses file-based routing. Link to pages using their route paths.

## Internal Links

Use site routes (no file extension):

```md
[Writing basics](/guide/writing)
```

Renders as: [Writing basics](/guide/writing)

If you move or rename a page, update the route in your links.

## External Links

Use full URLs for external sites:

```md
[Example](https://example.com)
```

Renders as: [Example](https://example.com)

## Navigation Order

Use frontmatter fields to control order and visibility:

- `weight`: lower numbers come first
- `hidden`: hide from the sidebar
- `isRoot`: use on an `index.mdx` to define a navigation root

Full details are in the [Frontmatter reference](/reference/frontmatter).
