# Links and Navigation

Methanol uses file-based routing. Link to pages using their route paths.

## Internal Links

Use site routes (no file extension):

```md
[Writing basics](./writing)
```

Renders as: [Writing basics](./writing)

If you move or rename a page, update the route in your links.

### Subpath Deployments (`site.base`)

If your site is served under a subpath (for example `https://example.com/docs/`), set `site.base: '/docs/'` and avoid root-absolute internal links like `/blog/post` in your content.

Prefer relative links:

```md
[Next post](./next-post)
[Back to blog](../blog/)
```

If you need to generate a root-absolute link in MDX/JSX, wrap it with `ctx.withBase`:

```mdx
<a href={ctx.withBase('/blog/post')}>Read</a>
```

## External Links

Use full URLs for external sites:

```md
[Example](https://example.com)
```

Renders as: [Example](https://example.com)

## Navigation Order

Use frontmatter fields to control order and visibility:

- `weight`: lower numbers come first
- `hidden`: hide from the sidebar
- `isRoot`: use on an `index.mdx` to define a navigation root

Full details are in the [Frontmatter reference](../reference/frontmatter).
