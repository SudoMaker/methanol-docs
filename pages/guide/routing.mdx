# Routing

Methanol automatically constructs a routing hierarchy based on the structure of the `pages/` directory.

## MDX and Markdown Pages

- `pages/about.mdx` → `/about`
- `pages/guide/index.mdx` → `/guide/` (directory index)

## `.html` Pages

Plain HTML files can also be placed within the `pages/` directory. These are included in the production build and processed by Vite:

- `pages/custom.html` → `dist/custom.html` (accessible via `/custom.html`)

Example:

- [Custom HTML page](../custom.html)

## 404 Page

Create `pages/404.mdx` to customize the "Not Found" page. This page is automatically hidden from the navigation menu.

## Offline Page

Create `pages/offline.mdx` to customize the offline fallback page utilized by the built-in PWA. This page is also hidden from navigation by default.

## Hidden vs. Excluded

- `hidden: true`: Hides the page from navigation menus, though the route remains active and accessible via direct URL.
- `exclude: true`: Completely removes the page from both development and build processes. When applied to a directory `index.mdx`, the entire directory is excluded.
- Files or directories beginning with `_` or `.` are ignored by the system.
