# Routing

Methanol uses file-based routing from `pages/`.

## MDX and Markdown pages

- `pages/about.mdx` → `/about`
- `pages/guide/index.mdx` → `/guide/` (directory index)

## `.html` pages

You can also place plain HTML files in `pages/`. They are included in the build and processed by Vite:

- `pages/custom.html` → `dist/custom.html` (visit `/custom.html`)

## 404 page

Create `pages/404.mdx` to customize the Not Found page (it is hidden from navigation by default).

## Hidden vs excluded

- `hidden: true` hides a page from navigation, but the route still exists and can be visited directly.
- `exclude: true` removes the page from dev/build (and on a directory `index.mdx`, excludes the whole directory).
- Files/directories starting with `_` or `.` are ignored.
