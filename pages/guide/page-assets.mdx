# Page-specific Scripts and Styles

Methanol features built-in support for page-specific assets. It automatically detects and includes scripts or stylesheets located in the same directory as a page file, provided they share the same base filename.

## Mechanism

Consider the following project structure:

```
pages/
  guide/
    components.mdx
    components.css
    components.js
```

When the `/guide/components` route is rendered, both `components.css` and `components.js` are automatically injected into the page `<head>`.

## Supported File Extensions

**Stylesheets:**
- `.css`

**Scripts:**
- `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`
- `.ts`, `.mts`, `.cts`

## Usage Example

```
pages/
  about.mdx
  about.css
  about.ts
```

In this configuration, `about.css` and `about.ts` will be loaded exclusively for the `/about` route.

## Important Notes

- **Resolution:** Resource resolution is relative to the page's parent directory.
- **Global Assets:** Global assets, such as `pages/style.css` and `pages/index.js`, are always applied across all pages in addition to page-specific ones.
