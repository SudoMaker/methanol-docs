# Page-specific Scripts and Styles

Methanol automatically detects and includes scripts or stylesheets located in the same directory as a page file, provided they share the same base filename.

## Mechanism

Consider the following project structure:

```
pages/
  guide/
    components.mdx
    components.css
    components.js
```

When `/guide/components` is rendered, both `components.css` and `components.js` are automatically injected into the page `<head>`.

## Supported File Extensions

Stylesheets:

- `.css`

Scripts:

- `.js`
- `.mjs`
- `.cjs`
- `.ts`
- `.mts`
- `.cts`

## Usage Example

```
pages/
  about.mdx
  about.css
  about.ts
```

In this configuration, `about.css` and `about.ts` will be loaded exclusively when accessing the `/about` route.

## Notes and Limitations

- Resource resolution is performed relative to the page's parent directory.
- Global assets (such as `pages/style.css` and `pages/index.js`) will continue to be applied across all pages.
