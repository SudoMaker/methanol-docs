# Offline Access (PWA)

Methanol ships a built-in PWA implementation with a custom service worker and a generated precache manifest. It precaches critical files during install and warms the rest in the background with revision-aware updates.

## Enabling PWA

To activate PWA features, update your `methanol.config.js`:

```js
export default () => ({
	pwa: true
})
```

### Manifest Customization

You can customize the PWA manifest and precache behavior as follows:

```js
export default () => ({
	pwa: {
		manifest: {
			name: 'My Site',
			short_name: 'My Site'
		},
		precache: {
			include: ['**/*.{html,js,css,ico,png,svg,webp,jpg,jpeg,gif,woff,woff2,ttf}'],
			exclude: ['**/*.map', '**/pagefind/**']
		}
	}
})
```

### Advanced Configuration

For full control over the PWA lifecycle (such as custom service worker strategies), set `pwa: false` and provide your own manifest/service worker.

## Custom Offline Page

Create `pages/offline.mdx` to customize the fallback page displayed when a user is offline and the requested content is not cached. You can also define `pages/404.mdx` for the not-found page; both are hidden from navigation by default.
