# Offline Access (PWA)

Methanol includes built-in PWA support powered by Workbox. It features a **highly optimized** Service Worker implementation designed to efficiently serve frequent content updates while ensuring that installation remains smooth and won't stall, even on large-scale documentation sites.

## Enabling PWA

Activate PWA features within `methanol.config.js`:

```js
export default () => ({
	pwa: true
})
```

### Manifest Customization

You can override the default PWA manifest and `injectManifest` configurations as follows:

```js
export default () => ({
	pwa: {
		manifest: {
			name: 'My Site',
			short_name: 'My Site'
		},
		injectManifest: {
			globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg}']
		}
	}
})
```

### Custom Configuration

If your project requires full control over the PWA setup (such as custom service worker strategies), set `pwa: false` and add your own `vite-plugin-pwa` configuration within the `vite.plugins` section.

## Custom Offline Page

Create a file at `pages/offline.mdx` (or `pages/offline/index.mdx`) to customize the fallback page displayed when a requested route is not cached and the user is offline.
