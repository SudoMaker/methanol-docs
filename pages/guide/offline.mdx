# Offline Access (PWA)

Methanol features built-in PWA support powered by Workbox. Its service worker implementation is highly optimized to ensure smooth installation and efficient content updates, even for large-scale documentation sites.

## Enabling PWA

To activate PWA features, update your `methanol.config.js`:

```js
export default () => ({
	pwa: true
})
```

### Manifest Customization

You can customize the PWA manifest and `injectManifest` configuration as follows:

```js
export default () => ({
	pwa: {
		manifest: {
			name: 'My Site',
			short_name: 'My Site'
		},
		injectManifest: {
			globPatterns: ['**/*.{js,css,html,ico,png,svg}']
		}
	}
})
```

### Advanced Configuration

For full control over the PWA lifecycle (such as custom service worker strategies), set `pwa: false` and add your own `vite-plugin-pwa` configuration to the `vite.plugins` section.

## Custom Offline Page

Create `pages/offline.mdx` to customize the fallback page displayed when a user is offline and the requested content is not cached.
