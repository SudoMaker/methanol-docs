# Images and Assets

Methanol provides two primary methods for managing static assets: global storage in the `public/` directory and local referencing for page-specific files.

## The `public/` Directory

Files placed within the `public/` directory are served directly from the site root.

Even when deploying to a subpath (`site.base !== '/'`), you typically do not need to wrap public asset paths with `ctx.withBase()`. Methanol automatically resolves these paths at build time.

However, if you are generating URLs dynamically within JavaScript (e.g., in client-only components) and encounter resolution issues in the development environment, `ctx.withBase('/...')` serves as a reliable workaround.

```
public/
  logo.png
  downloads/
    brochure.pdf
```

Referencing assets in MDX:

```md
![Logo](/logo.png)
[Download Brochure](/downloads/brochure.pdf)
```

## Local Asset Referencing

You may also store images alongside your page files and reference them using relative paths:

```
pages/
  guide/
    writing.mdx
    writing-diagram.png
```

```md
![Diagram](./writing-diagram.png)
```

## Global Styles and Scripts

If a `pages/style.css` file exists, Methanol automatically injects it into every page. Similarly, `pages/index.js` or `pages/index.ts` will be injected as a module script globally.

These URLs are automatically adjusted for Base Path during production builds (equivalent to utilizing `ctx.withBase('/style.css')` or `ctx.withBase('/index.js')`).

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" />
<script type="module" src="/index.js"></script>
```
