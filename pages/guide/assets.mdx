# Images and Assets

Use `public/` for static assets and local relative paths for page-specific files.

## Public Folder

Files in `public/` are served from the site root.

Even when you deploy under a subpath (`site.base !== '/'`), you typically *don’t* need to wrap public assets with `ctx.withBase()`: Methanol resolves public assets at build time.

If you’re generating URLs in JS (client-only components) and hit Vite dev inconsistencies, `ctx.withBase('/...')` can be a practical workaround.

```
public/
  logo.png
  downloads/
    brochure.pdf
```

Use them in MDX:

```md
![Logo](/logo.png)
[Download the brochure](/downloads/brochure.pdf)
```

## Local Files

You can also keep images beside a page and link with a relative path:

```
pages/
  guide/
    writing.mdx
    writing-diagram.png
```

```md
![Diagram](./writing-diagram.png)
```

## Global Styles and Scripts

If you add `pages/style.css`, Methanol injects it into every page. If you add `pages/index.js` or `pages/index.ts`, Methanol injects that as a module script.

These URLs are base-aware in production builds (equivalent to `ctx.withBase('/style.css')` and `ctx.withBase('/index.js')`).

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css" />
<script type="module" src="/index.js"></script>
```
