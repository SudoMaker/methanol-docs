# Page Ordering

Methanol automatically builds site navigation based on your `pages/` directory structure. Within each directory, items are sorted according to the following algorithm:

1) `/` (The site root index) always takes precedence.
2) `index.mdx` is positioned before other pages within the same folder. Its Frontmatter also defines the folder's display label and display order.
3) `weight`: Items are sorted in ascending order (smaller values appear first). Unweighted items are placed after weighted items.
4) `date`: Items are sorted in descending order (most recent first) when weights are identical. Items without a date are placed after dated items.
5) Finally, remaining items are sorted alphabetically by `title` (or filename/directory name).

## Best Practices

- For directories, define ordering and labeling metadata in the directory's `index.mdx` file.
- Use `weight` for permanent, stable navigation structures and `date` for time-sensitive lists.
- Files or directories prefixed with `_` or `.` are automatically excluded from the navigation tree.

## Configuration Example

```mdx
