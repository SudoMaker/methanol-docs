# Page Ordering

Methanol builds navigation from your `pages/` directory. Within each directory, items are sorted using these rules:

1) `/` (the root index page) always comes first.
2) `index.mdx` comes before other pages in the same folder. Its frontmatter also controls the folder label and ordering.
3) `weight` sorts ascending (smaller numbers first). Items without `weight` come after weighted items.
4) `date` sorts descending (newer first) when weights match. Items without `date` come after dated items.
5) Finally, items are sorted alphabetically by `title` (or file/folder name).

## Practical tips

- For folders, put ordering metadata on the folder `index.mdx`.
- Use `weight` for stable ordering, and `date` for “latest first” lists.
- Files or directories starting with `_` or `.` are excluded from navigation.

## Example

```mdx
