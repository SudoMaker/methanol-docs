# Build and Publish

Methanol outputs a static site, so you can deploy the `dist/` directory to any static host.

## Build

```bash
npx methanol build
```

This generates `dist/`.

## Preview

```bash
npx methanol serve
```

Use this to verify the production output locally.

## Deploy

Upload the `dist/` folder to your host of choice (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, S3, or any static server).
