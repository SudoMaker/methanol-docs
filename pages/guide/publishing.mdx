# Build and Publish

Methanol outputs a static site, so you can deploy the `dist/` directory to any static host.

## Build

```bash
npx methanol build
```

This generates `dist/`.

## Preview

```bash
npx methanol serve
```

Use this to verify the production output locally.

## Deploy

Upload the `dist/` folder to your host of choice (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, S3, or any static server).

## Deploy Under a Subpath

If your site is served under a subpath (e.g. `https://example.com/docs/`), set `site.base` in `methanol.config.*`:

```js
export default () => ({
	site: {
		base: '/docs/'
	}
})
```

In dev (`methanol dev`), `site.base` is ignored and treated as `/`. Verify subpath behavior with `methanol build` + `methanol serve`.
