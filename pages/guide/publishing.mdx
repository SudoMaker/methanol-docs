# Build and Deployment

Methanol generates purely static artifacts, allowing the `dist/` directory to be hosted on any standard static web server or hosting provider.

## Executing a Build

```bash
npx methanol build
```

This command triggers an optimized build and populates the `dist/` directory with the resulting files.

## Local Preview

```bash
npx methanol serve
```

Use this command to validate the production artifacts in a local environment prior to deployment.

## Deployment Strategy

Upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your preferred hosting service, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, Amazon S3, or any specialized static host.

## Deploying to a Subpath

If your site is to be served from a subpath (e.g., `https://example.com/docs/`), configure the `site.base` property in `methanol.config.*`:

```js
export default () => ({
	site: {
		base: '/docs/'
	}
})
```

During development (`methanol dev`), the `site.base` setting is ignored and the site is served from the root `/`. To verify subpath behavior, use the `methanol build` and `methanol serve` workflow.
