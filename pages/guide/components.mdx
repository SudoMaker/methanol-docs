# Using Components

MDX allows you to directly embed [rEFui](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui) JSX components within your Markdown. By placing reusable components in the `components/` directory, they become seamlessly integrated and available for use across all pages.

## Component Creation

```jsx
// components/Callout.jsx
export default function Callout(props, ...children) {
	return <div class="callout">{...children}</div>
}
```

## Utilization in MDX

```mdx
<Callout>
  Tip: Maintain concise and focused sections to improve readability.
</Callout>
```

## Client-side Interactivity

For components that require access to browser-specific APIs, append the `.client` suffix to the filename:

```
components/Map.client.jsx
```

## Interactive Example: Counter

Below is a simple interactive component:

```jsx
// components/Counter.client.jsx
import './Counter.css'
import { signal } from 'refui'

export default function Counter({ initial = 0 }) {
	const count = signal(initial)
	return (
		<div class="counter">
			<button on:click={() => count.value--}>-</button>
			<span>{count}</span>
			<button on:click={() => count.value++}>+</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

As this component includes a CSS import (which is incompatible with server-side static rendering), a corresponding static version must be provided for the build process:

```jsx
// components/Counter.static.jsx
export default function Counter({ initial = 0 }) {
	return (
		<div>
			[ JavaScript is required to load this component. ]
		</div>
	)
}
```

Invoking the component within a page:

```mdx
<Counter />
```

Live Preview:

<Counter />
