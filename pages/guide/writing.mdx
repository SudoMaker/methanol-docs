# Writing Basics

Methanol provides native support for Markdown and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). Standard Markdown syntax satisfies most structural and content requirements, while JSX components can be introduced for advanced layouts or interactive features.

## Page Structure

```mdx
---
title: My Page
excerpt: Short summary used for meta tags
---

# My Page

Content goes here.
```

The block at the top, enclosed by `---`, is the Frontmatter. It is used to define page configurations and metadata, as detailed below.

## Headings and Table of Contents

`##`, `###`, and `####` headings are automatically utilized to generate the table of contents. Maintaining a clear hierarchy ensures the sidebar navigation remains readable.

## Body Text and Paragraphs

In Markdown, content is primarily composed of paragraphs:

- Separate paragraphs with a **blank line**.
- Newlines within a single paragraph are typically treated as spaces (no forced line break).
- To force a line break, add two spaces at the end of a line or use the `<br />` tag (MDX supports JSX/HTML).

Example:

```md
First paragraph line 1
First paragraph line 2 (typically merges with the previous line)

Second paragraph
This line ends with two spaces  
resulting in a line break
```

## Blockquotes

```mdx
> This is a blockquote.
>
> A line containing only `>` represents a blank line within the same block.
> Consecutive quoted lines are merged into a single block.

> A blank line between `>` blocks renders them as separate quotes.
```

Rendered result:

> This is a blockquote.
>
> A line containing only `>` represents a blank line within the same block.
> Consecutive quoted lines are merged into a single block.

> A blank line between `>` blocks renders them as separate quotes.

## Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers for syntax highlighting:

<pre>
	<code class="language-md">
		{`\`\`\`js
export const title = 'Hello'
\`\`\``}
	</code>
</pre>

Rendered result:

```js
export const title = 'Hello'
```

## Frontmatter Configuration Tips

Frequently used fields for authors:

- `title`: Page title and navigation label.
- `excerpt`: Brief description for Meta tags.
- `date`: Publication date (ISO format).
- `weight`: Navigation display order.

For a full list of available fields, see the [Frontmatter Reference](../reference/frontmatter).
