# Writing Basics

Methanol supports Markdown and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). Use Markdown for structure, and add JSX components when you want richer layouts or interactivity.

## Basic Page

```mdx
---
title: My Page
excerpt: Short summary used in meta tags
---

# My Page

Write your content here.
```

The `---` block at the top is called *frontmatter*. See below for what it does.

## Headings and TOC

Headings (`##`, `###`, `####`) are used to build the table of contents. Keep a clear hierarchy for the sidebar TOC to stay readable.

## Body Text

In Markdown, your content is usually made of paragraphs:

- Separate paragraphs with a **blank line**.
- A newline inside the same paragraph is usually treated as a space.
- To force a line break, add two trailing spaces or write `<br />` (MDX supports JSX/HTML).

```md
First paragraph line 1
First paragraph line 2 (usually merges into the same paragraph)

Second paragraph
This line has two trailing spaces  
so it breaks
```

## Blockquotes

```mdx
> This is a blockquote.
>
> Put `>` on an empty line to keep a blank line inside the same quote.
> Multiple quoted lines become one quote block.

> A blank line between `>` blocks creates a new quote block.
```

This renders as:

> This is a blockquote.
>
> Put `>` on an empty line to keep a blank line inside the same quote.
> Multiple quoted lines become one quote block.

> A blank line between `>` blocks creates a new quote block.

## Code Blocks

Use fenced code blocks with language identifiers:

<pre>
	<code class="language-md">
		{`\`\`\`js
export const title = 'Hello'
\`\`\``}
	</code>
</pre>

This renders as:

```js
export const title = 'Hello'
```

## Frontmatter Tips

Common fields for authors:
