# Welcome to Methanol!

Methanol is an opinionated, fully customizable static site generator powered by [rEFui](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). It’s fast, uncluttered, and built for clear writing, bold ideas, and whatever you want to make.

It works out of the box: drop files into `pages/` (or `docs/`), get routes automatically, a homepage from `index.mdx`, and a navigation tree without wiring up a router.

## Start Here

- [Quick start](/quick-start) to get a local dev server running.
- [Guide overview](/guide/) for day-to-day authoring and publishing.
- [Reference](/reference/) for CLI, config, and frontmatter details.
- [Advanced](/advanced/) for theming, custom components, and runtime details.

## What You Can Do

- Write MDX in `pages/` (or `docs/`) and get routes automatically.
- Add reusable components in `components/` and drop them into Markdown.
- Control navigation, ordering, and visibility with frontmatter.
- Build to static files in `dist/` and preview locally.
- Add search with [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) and syntax highlighting with [Starry Night](https://github.com/wooorm/starry-night) when you want them.

## rEFui: HTML + islands

Methanol uses rEFui for both server-side HTML generation and client-side interactivity. Most pages ship as static HTML, and only client components are hydrated as small “islands” where needed (no full-page hydration).
