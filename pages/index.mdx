Methanol is an opinionated, fully customizable static site generator powered by [rEFui](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com). Designed for speed and clarity, it provides a streamlined environment for technical writing and creative ideas.

Methanol requires nearly zero configuration: simply place your files in `pages/` (or `docs/`) to automatically generate routes, a homepage from `index.mdx`, and a complete navigation tree.

## Core Features

- **Automated Routing**: Drop MDX files into content directories and let Methanol handle the routing and navigation.
- **Component Integration**: Author reusable JSX components in `components/` and embed them directly within your Markdown.
- **Fine-grained Control**: Manage navigation hierarchy, ordering, and visibility using standard frontmatter.
- **Production Ready**: Build to optimized static files in `dist/` with built-in preview capabilities.
- **Extensible Pipeline**: Easily integrate [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app) for search and [Starry Night](https://github.com/wooorm/starry-night) for syntax highlighting.

## rEFui: HTML + Islands

Methanol leverages rEFui for both server-side HTML generation and client-side interactivity. The majority of your site is shipped as pure static HTML; only interactive client components are hydrated as isolated "islands" where necessary, avoiding the overhead of full-page hydration.
