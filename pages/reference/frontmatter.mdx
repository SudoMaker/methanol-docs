# Frontmatter

Frontmatter is a YAML data block located at the absolute top of a page. It provides a mechanism for defining page metadata and exercising fine-grained control over navigation hierarchy and sorting behavior.

```mdx
---
title: Guides
weight: 10
hidden: false
isRoot: true
exclude: false
date: 2025-01-01
starryNight: true
---
```

## Metadata Specifications

- `title`: The page title utilized within navigation menus and the HTML `<title>` tag.
- `excerpt` / `description`: A brief summary utilized for Meta tags (these are aliases; either can be used).
- `weight`: Navigation display order; items with lower values are positioned higher.
- `hidden`: Excludes the page from navigation menus (the `/404`, `/offline`, and `isRoot` pages are hidden by default). Hidden pages remain fully accessible via their direct URL.
- `isRoot`: Designates the `index.mdx` file as the root node for a navigation sub-tree.
- `exclude`: Completely removes the page from development and build processes. If applied to a directory `index.mdx`, the entire directory is excluded.
- `date`: Used as a secondary sorting criterion when weights are identical.
- `lang`: The display label for the language selector; only processed from directory `index.mdx` files (including the root `/`).
- `langCode`: The language code applied to the HTML `lang` attribute; only processed from directory `index.mdx` files.
- `starryNight`: A page-level override for syntax highlighting (`true`, `false`, or a configuration object).

## Key Implementation Notes

- The `isRoot` property is only applicable to `index.mdx` files.
- `isRoot` index pages are concealed from navigation by default; set `hidden: false` to force display.
- Automated exclusion: Files or directories prefixed with `_` or `.` are permanently excluded from the navigation tree.
- Frontmatter settings for `starryNight` take precedence over both global configuration and CLI flags.
- Frontmatter parsing is implemented via [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).

## Examples

- [Hidden Section](../hidden/)
- [Hidden Page](../hidden-page)

## Multi-language Index Configuration

Configure the `lang` property exclusively on the index page of each language directory:

```mdx
---
title: English
lang: English
langCode: en
isRoot: true
hidden: true
---
```
