# `Head` / `head`

Methanol provides a built-in `Head` component (aliased as `head`) available within all `.mdx` pages. It can be utilized directly without the need for an explicit import.

Any elements rendered within the `Head` component are automatically aggregated and injected into the final HTML `<head>` section (provided the active theme renders `<ExtraHead />`; the standard Methanol theme includes this by default).

## Usage Example

```html
<Head>
	<meta name="description" content="A detailed description of the page content." />
	<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/docs/page" />
</Head>
```

## Convention-based Resource Injection

Methanol also automatically injects the following assets into the `<head>` based on directory conventions:

- `pages/style.css` (if detected).
- `pages/index.js` or `pages/index.ts` (if detected).
- Page-specific stylesheets or scripts located alongside the MDX file (e.g., `guide.mdx` → `guide.css`, `guide.js`, `guide.ts`, etc.).
