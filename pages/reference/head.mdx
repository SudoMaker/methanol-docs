# `Head` / `head`

Methanol always provides a `Head` component (alias: `head`) inside every `.mdx` page, so you can use it without importing anything.

Anything you render inside `Head` is collected and injected into the document `<head>` (your theme must render `<ExtraHead />`; the default theme does).

## Example

```html
<Head>
	<meta name="description" content="My page description" />
	<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/docs/page" />
</Head>
```

## Automatic head assets

Methanol also injects some assets into `<head>` automatically:

- `pages/style.css` (if present)
- `pages/index.js` / `pages/index.ts` (if present)
- A page-local stylesheet/script next to the MDX file (e.g. `guide.mdx` → `guide.css`, `guide.js`, `guide.ts`, etc.)
