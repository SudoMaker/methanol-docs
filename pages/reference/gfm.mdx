# GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)

This page serves as a demonstration of GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) features supported within the Methanol environment.

It is particularly useful for validating your Markdown processing pipeline, including parsing, styling, and theme-level rendering.

## What is GFM?

GFM is a widely-used dialect of Markdown maintained by GitHub. It extends the core Markdown specification with practical authoring features, such as:

- Tables
- Task lists (Checkboxes)
- Strikethrough
- Footnotes
- Autolink literals (Automatic URL and email recognition)

In Methanol, GFM support is enabled by default. To disable it, modify your configuration as follows:

```js
// methanol.config.js
export default () => ({
	gfm: false
})
```
