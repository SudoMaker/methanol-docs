# Pages Index (`methanol:pages`)

The `methanol:pages` virtual module provides a list of all pages in your project, facilitating client-side features such as blog archives, category filters, and custom search interfaces.

```js
import pages from 'methanol:pages'
// or
import { pages } from 'methanol:pages'
```

## Included Content

Each entry in the index represents a page and its metadata. Heavy fields are automatically stripped to keep the bundle size small:

- **Stripped fields:** `content`, `mdxCtx`, and `getSiblings`.
- **Omitted values:** Any function-type fields.
- **Always included:** `excerpt`. If not explicitly defined in the frontmatter, Methanol generates one from the page content.
- **Exclusion:** Hidden pages (`hidden: true`) are omitted from the index.

The resulting objects contain metadata such as `routePath`, `routeHref`, `title`, `frontmatter`, `stats`, and `excerpt`.

## Notes

- This module is designed strictly for **client-side** logic.
- In development mode, the index is automatically updated whenever pages are modified.
