# Languages (Multi-language Directories)

Methanol supports multi-language sites by treating each **directory index page** with a `lang` field as a language entry. This is a lightweight way to organize translations without a separate i18n system.

## How It Works

- A directory `index.mdx` with `lang` becomes a **language root**.
- The label shown in the language selector is the `lang` value.
- The active language is resolved by matching the current route to the closest language root.
- The HTML `lang` attribute uses `langCode` when provided (including the root index), otherwise the directory name.

Example structure:

```
pages/
  index.mdx          # root language
  zh/
    index.mdx        # Chinese language root
    guide.mdx
  fr/
    index.mdx        # French language root
    guide.mdx
```

Example frontmatter:

```mdx
---
title: 简体中文
lang: 简体中文
langCode: zh
isRoot: true
hidden: true
---
```

## Language Selector

The default theme shows a language selector when it finds any directory `index.mdx` pages with `lang` defined (including the root `/`). It uses:

- `lang` for the display label
- `ctx.language` for the current selection

## Navigation Roots

A language root often pairs with `isRoot: true` to scope the navigation tree to that directory.

Note: `isRoot` pages are hidden by default. Set `hidden: false` if you want the language root to appear in the sidebar.

This allows separate navigation trees for each language.

## What `ctx.languages` Contains

`ctx.languages` is an array of language entries collected from directory index pages with `lang`:

```js
{
	routePath: '/zh',
	href: '/zh/',
	label: '简体中文',
	code: 'zh'
}
```

The root language appears at `/` when the root `index.mdx` includes `lang`.

## Tips

- `isRoot` pages are hidden by default; set `hidden: false` if you want a language root to appear in the sidebar.
- Keep translations in matching paths (`/guide` and `/ja/guide`) for predictable structure.
- Use `isRoot: true` on language index pages to keep default language entries from showing up in the route list while still scoping navigation.
