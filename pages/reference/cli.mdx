# CLI

Methanol includes a dedicated Command-line Interface (CLI) designed to streamline development, execution of static builds, and local previews.

## Core Commands

Quick start with `npx` (recommended):

```bash
npx methanol dev      # Initialize the development server
npx methanol build    # Execute production build to the dist/ directory
npx methanol serve    # Preview the production build locally
```

For improved performance and faster startup times, consider a global installation:

```bash
npm install methanol -g
methanol dev
```

The `input` and `output` paths can be provided as positional arguments (order is significant):

```bash
npx methanol build ./pages ./dist
```

In `dev` mode, only the `input` argument is utilized:

```bash
npx methanol dev ./pages
```

## Flag Reference

- `--input`, `-i`: Specifies the source directory (overrides the default `pages/`).
- `--components`: Specifies the components directory (overrides the default `components/`).
- `--assets`: Specifies the static assets directory (overrides the default `public/`).
- `--output`, `-o`: Specifies the build destination (overrides the default `dist/`).
- `--config`, `-c`: Defines the path to a custom configuration file.
- `--theme`: Overrides the `theme` configuration. When a string is provided, Methanol first attempts to resolve it as a built-in theme (e.g., `default`, `blog`). If not found, it searches for a package named `methanol-theme-xxx` (where `xxx` is the provided string). You can also provide a direct file path to a theme's entry point.
- `--site-name`: Overrides the site title defined in configuration.
- `--base`: Temporarily overrides `site.base` for the current execution (ignored in `dev` mode).
- `--port`: Sets the port for the development and preview servers (default: 5173).
- `--host`: Binds the server to a specific host (using `--host` without a value binds to all interfaces).
- `--intermediate-dir`: Directory for intermediate HTML output (build only).
- `--emit-intermediate`: Enables the output of intermediate HTML to `build/` (build only).
- `--highlight`/`--no-highlight`: Controls syntax highlighting.
- `--jobs`, `-j`: Sets the build worker thread count (`0` auto scales with page count).
- `--search`/`--no-search`: Controls Pagefind search indexing.
- `--pwa`/`--no-pwa`: Controls PWA support.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: Enables detailed logging, including Vite and Pagefind output during the build process.

Syntax highlighting is enabled by default and can be disabled per-execution via `--no-highlight`.

## Execution via Node

```bash
node node_modules/methanol/bin/methanol.js dev
```
