# Custom Components

Methanol loads components from `components/` and makes them available in every MDX file. Components are rendered with [rEFui](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui), so you can rely on its JSX runtime and APIs when building custom UI.

## Component Discovery

- Files can be `.jsx`, `.tsx`, `.js`, or `.ts`.
- The file name becomes the component name.
- User components override theme components with the same name.

Example:

```
components/
  Callout.jsx
  Hero.client.jsx
  Toc.static.jsx
```

## Client-Only Components

Use the `.client` suffix to mark components that should only run on the client. This is useful for components that rely on browser APIs.

```
components/ThemeSearch.client.jsx
```

## Static Components

Use the `.static` suffix for components that should be evaluated at build time.

If a client-only component does not have a server/static counterpart, Methanol will try to statically render the client component. If the client component uses browser-only APIs, you must provide a corresponding static component for server rendering.

```
components/Notice.static.jsx
```

## Importing and Using

```jsx
// components/Callout.jsx
export default function Callout({ title }, ...children) {
	return (
		<div class="callout">
			<strong>{title}</strong>
			<div>{...children}</div>
		</div>
	)
}
```

```jsx
<Callout title="Tip">
  Keep paragraphs short for scannable docs.
</Callout>
```
