# Blog Theme

Methanol features a built-in blog theme (`themes/blog`) designed for content-focused sites. It provides:

- Specialized layouts for home, category, and collection pages.
- Dynamic client-side filtering powered by the `methanol:pages` virtual module.
- High-performance rendering: initial lists are statically rendered for a fast first paint, then hydrated to enable interactive filtering and pagination.

## Nav links

The theme retrieves `navLinks` from your project's root page (`pages/index.mdx`). While sensible defaults are provided, you can customize the navigation in your frontmatter:

```mdx
---
navLinks:
  - label: Home
    href: /
  - label: About
    href: /about
  - label: Categories
    href: /categories
  - label: Collections
    href: /collections
---
```

Internal links are automatically processed to be base-path aware.

## Collections and titles

Collections are automatically inferred from the top-level directory of a page (e.g., `/series/post` is grouped into the `series` collection). The collection label uses the title of the collection's index page (e.g., `/series/index.mdx`) if it exists; otherwise, it defaults to the directory slug.

## Hidden posts

Pages marked with `hidden: true` are excluded from all automated listings and the `methanol:pages` index.
