# Blog Theme

Methanol includes a built-in blog theme located under `themes/blog`. It provides the following features:

- Specialized layouts for the home page, categories, and collections.
- Dynamic client-side filtering powered by the `methanol:pages` virtual module.
- Optimized performance: initial page lists are statically rendered for fast first paint, followed by hydration to support interactive filtering and pagination.

## Nav links

The blog theme retrieves `navLinks` from `pages/index.mdx` (or the root page of your project). While the theme provides default links, you can override them in your frontmatter:

```mdx
---
navLinks:
  - label: Home
    href: /
  - label: About
    href: /about
  - label: Categories
    href: /categories
  - label: Collections
    href: /collections
---
```

Internal links are automatically processed to be base-path aware (via `withBase`).

## Collections and titles

Collections are automatically inferred from the first directory segment of a page's path (e.g., `/series/post` belongs to the `series` collection). The collection label is derived from the title of the collection's index page (e.g., `/series/index.mdx`) if available; otherwise, it defaults to the directory slug.

## Hidden posts

Pages marked with `hidden: true` in their frontmatter are excluded from all automated listings and from the `methanol:pages` index.
