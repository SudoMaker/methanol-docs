# rEFui Runtime

Methanol uses [rEFui](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui) as its JSX runtime. You do not need to learn rEFui to write docs, but it is useful for theme and component authors who want to build richer UI.

Methanol uses rEFui on both sides:

- **Server/SSG:** render JSX to HTML during `build` (and on the dev server).
- **Client:** hydrate only client components as small “islands”, leaving the rest of the page as static HTML.

## When It Matters

- Writing custom templates (`theme.template`)
- Building interactive components in `components/`
- Using `rawHTML` and context helpers

## JSX Runtime

Methanol compiles MDX with the automatic JSX runtime and `refui` as the import source. You can still write standard JSX components.

```jsx
export default function Callout(props, ...children) {
	return <div class="callout">{...children}</div>
}
```

## Component Demo (Web)

If you want to experiment with rEFui outside Methanol, use the DOM renderer with a small reactive component:

```jsx
import { signal } from 'refui'
import { createDOMRenderer } from 'refui/dom'
import { defaults } from 'refui/browser'

const DOMRenderer = createDOMRenderer(defaults)

const App = () => {
	const count = signal(0)
	const increment = () => {
		count.value += 1
	}

	return (R) => (
		<>
			<h1>Hello, rEFui</h1>
			<button on:click={increment}>Click me! Count is {count}</button>
			<p>Double: {$(() => count.value * 2)}</p>
		</>
	)
}

DOMRenderer.render(document.body, App)
```

In Methanol, you typically export components and let the MDX renderer handle mounting.

## Reference

See the [rEFui repository](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui) for detailed runtime and renderer documentation.
