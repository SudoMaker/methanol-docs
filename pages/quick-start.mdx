# Quick Start

Methanol transforms a directory of Markdown and MDX files into a high-performance static site with automatic routing, navigation, and a robust build pipeline.

Getting started is simple: create `pages/index.mdx`, add your content, and Methanol will automatically build the routes and navigation tree.

## Instant Preview

Experience Methanol immediately by running the development server via `npx`:

```bash
npx methanol dev
```

Then, open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Using an Existing Directory

If you already have a collection of Markdown or MDX files, point Methanol directly to that directory:

```bash
npx methanol dev ./my-docs
```

The specified folder becomes the content root; for example, `./my-docs/index.mdx` maps to the site root (`/`).

## Installation

For frequent use, we recommend installing Methanol globally to benefit from faster CLI startup:

```bash
npm install methanol -g
methanol dev
```

## Production Workflow

Generate an optimized production build and preview it locally:

```bash
methanol build
methanol serve
```

The `serve` command hosts the contents of the `dist/` directory for final verification.

## Advanced Build Example

Methanol's CLI supports various flags to override configurations on the fly:

```bash
methanol build --pwa --search --theme blog --site-name "My Site"
```

This command enables PWA and search indexing, switches to the `blog` theme, and sets a custom site name.

## Project Structure

- `pages/`: MDX/MD source files (alternatively `docs/`).
- `components/`: Reusable JSX/TSX components.
- `public/`: Static assets (overrides theme-provided assets).
- `dist/`: Optimized production output.

Files in `public/` are served at the site root (e.g., `public/logo.png` → `/logo.png`).

## Creating Your First Page

Create `pages/index.mdx` with the following content:

```mdx
---
title: Home
---

# Welcome

This is my new documentation site.
```

The file structure is automatically mapped to URL routes:

```
pages/index.mdx       -> /
pages/guide.mdx       -> /guide
pages/blog/post.mdx   -> /blog/post
```
