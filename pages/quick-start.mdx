# Quick Start

Methanol turns a folder of Markdown and MDX files into a static site with routing, navigation, and a build pipeline.

No special setup is required: create `pages/index.mdx`, add more files/folders, and Methanol will build routes and navigation automatically.

## Run for a Quick Try

For a fast start, run Methanol directly with `npx`:

```bash
npx methanol dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

## Use an Existing Markdown Folder

If you already have Markdown or MDX files in a folder, point Methanol at it:

```bash
npx methanol dev ./my-docs
```

That folder becomes the content root, so `./my-docs/index.mdx` maps to `/`.

## Faster Local Workflow

If you want a faster CLI startup, install globally and use `methanol` directly:

```bash
npm install methanol -g
methanol dev
```

## Build for Production

```bash
npx methanol build
npx methanol serve
```

`serve` runs a local preview using the production output in `dist/`.

## Project Layout

```
pages/        # MDX/MD pages (or use docs/)
components/   # JSX/TSX components used in MDX
public/       # static assets (override theme assets)
build/        # intermediate HTML (optional)
dist/         # production output
```

Files in `public/` are served at `/` (e.g. `public/logo.png` → `/logo.png`) and override theme-provided public assets.

## First Page

Create a file at `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: Home
---

# Welcome

This is my site.
```

The file path becomes the route:

```
pages/index.mdx       -> /
pages/guide.mdx       -> /guide
pages/blog/post.mdx   -> /blog/post
```
