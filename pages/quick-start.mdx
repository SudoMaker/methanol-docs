# Quick Start

Methanol transforms a directory of Markdown and MDX files into a high-performance static site equipped with automatic routing, navigation, and a robust build pipeline.

Minimal setup is required: simply create `pages/index.mdx`, add your content, and Methanol will automatically construct the routes and navigation tree.

## Run for a Quick Try

To experience Methanol immediately, execute the following command using `npx`:

```bash
npx methanol dev
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Use an Existing Markdown Directory

If you already have a collection of Markdown or MDX files, you can point Methanol directly at that directory:

```bash
npx methanol dev ./my-docs
```

The specified folder becomes the content root; for example, `./my-docs/index.mdx` will map to the site root `/`.

## Workflow Optimization

For frequent usage, we recommend a global installation to benefit from faster CLI startup times:

```bash
npm install methanol -g
methanol dev
```

## Production Deployment

```bash
npx methanol build
npx methanol serve
```

The `serve` command initiates a local preview using the optimized production output located in the `dist/` directory.

## Project Layout

```
pages/        # MDX/MD source files (or use docs/)
components/   # Reusable JSX/TSX components
public/       # Static assets (overrides theme-provided assets)
build/        # Intermediate HTML artifacts (optional)
dist/         # Optimized production output
```

Files within the `public/` directory are served at the root path (e.g., `public/logo.png` → `/logo.png`) and take precedence over theme-provided assets.

## Creating Your First Page

Create a file at `pages/index.mdx`:

```mdx
---
title: Home
---

# Welcome

This is my documentation site.
```

The file structure is automatically mapped to URL routes:

```
pages/index.mdx       -> /
pages/guide.mdx       -> /guide
pages/blog/post.mdx   -> /blog/post
```
